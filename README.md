# Favorite Movie Webpage

A project by Christopher Stieg for the **Programming Foundations With Python**
course, which is part of the **Full Stack Nanodegree** from 
[Udacity.com](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).
It creates an HTML document displaying a list of movie posters, which play the
trailer when clicked.

## Components
* _Main.py_ creates Movie objects and stores them in an array, and passes the
array to _fresh_tomatoes.py_
* _Fresh_tomatoes.py_ contains the HTML templates provided by Udacity

## Getting Started
* Make sure [Python](www.python.org) is installed.
* Open the command prompt and cd to folder containing this module
* Run the command python main.py.  The webpage should automatically open
in the browser.
